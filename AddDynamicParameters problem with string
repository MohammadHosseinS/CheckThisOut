Why .adddynamicparameters(...); doesn't work with  string?

    A part of the above article:
    
For example, say you have a varchar database column, but send a string parameter using the AddWithValue() function.
ADO.Net will send this to the database as an nvarchar value.
The database is not permitted to implicitly convert your nvarchar parameter to a varchar value to match the column type for the query.
That would be a narrowing conversion that has the potential to lose information from the original value (because you might have non-Latin characters in the parameter),
    and if that happened the database might produce the wrong query results.
Instead, the database will likely need to convert the varchar column to nvarchar for this query (which is a widening conversion that is guaranteed not to lose information). The problem is that it will need to do this for every row in your table.
